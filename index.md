I've noticed that writing out my ideas sometimes helps me think clearer and formalize things, and putting it on the internet motivates me to do that more.

I have a [personal feedback form](https://forms.gle/wkUg21KLoXm6px1JA) so feel free to use it to send me anonymous constructive feedback about how I can be better.

I'm always up to chat! If you're seeing this you should totally [email](george.ingebretsen@gmail.com) me or reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Newton_theMan).
