A blog about my scattered interests. I'll probably post some:
- takes on AI Alignment
- takes about thinking better on purpose
- book reviews
- cool things I learn
and that sorta thing!

I'm always up to chat! Feel free to [email](george.ingebretsen@gmail.com) me or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Newton_theMan)!
