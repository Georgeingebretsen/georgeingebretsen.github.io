Writing about some of my scattered thoughts and interests! (partially as an incentive to articulate my thoughts more)
I'll probably post some:
- takes on AI alignment
- takes about thinking better on purpose
- book reviews
- cool things I learn
and that sorta thing!

I'm always up to chat! Feel free to [email](george.ingebretsen@gmail.com) me or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Newton_theMan)!
