I've noticed that writing out my ideas sometimes helps me think clearer and formalize things, and putting it on the internet motivates me to do that more.

I use an Admonymous personal feedback form https://www.admonymous.co/georgeingebretsen for anonymous constructive feedback about how I can be better! I really appreciate it.

I'm always up to chat. If you're seeing this you should totally [email](george.ingebretsen@gmail.com) me or reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Newton_theMan).
