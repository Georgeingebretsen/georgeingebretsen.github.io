I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley doing what I can to make AI go well!

In the past, I've worked on multi-turn jailbreaks, singular learning theory, and interpretability.

I use [this form](https://www.admonymous.co/georgeingebretsen) for anonymous feedback/messages about how I can be better, and really appreciate people taking the time to fill it out.

I'm always up to chat. If you're seeing this you should totally [email](george.ingebretsen@gmail.com) me or reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Newton_theMan)!

I also sometimes post on [lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/george-ingebretsen) :)
