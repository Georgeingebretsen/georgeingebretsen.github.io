I've noticed that writing out my ideas sometimes helps me think clearer and formalize things, and putting it on the internet motivates me to do that more.

I use [this form](https://www.admonymous.co/georgeingebretsen) for constructive feedback about how I can be better, and really appreciate people taking the time to fill it out.

I'm always up to chat. If you're seeing this you should totally [email](george.ingebretsen@gmail.com) me or reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Newton_theMan)!
