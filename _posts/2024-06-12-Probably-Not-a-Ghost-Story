Something happened to me a few months back that still don't have a satisfying explanation for.

It was a small, 10x10 room and I was on my way out. Still a few paces from being within arms-length of the light switch, I was asked "George, could you turn off the light?"

But before I could make it to the light or respond, the room went dark. 
I stood there shocked, standing still in the darkness until the lights came on, probably 3/4 of a second later. 

Object-level:
- When the lights turned off, I had an immediate (and probably visible) "wait, what?" reaction. The other person in the room also appeared confused, possibly reacting just after me.
	- It's unclear who displayed their reaction first. There might have been a feedback loop, with my reaction influencing theirs, or vice versa.
- At all times, I was farther than arm's length from the light switch. After the lights went out and I recovered from the initial shock, I had to walk about two paces to investigate the switch.
- After the light returned, and I walked to check out the switch, it was still in the "on" position.
- I didn't hear any "flip" sounds that would indicate the switch being toggled.
- The oven clock in the apartment still displayed the correct time.
	- But I don't have good reason to expect it should.
- There were no reported outages on [PG&E outage center](https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/outage-tools/outage-map/).
	- But I don't have good reason to expect it should've been.
- The room was lit by 4 overhead lights, all controlled by the single switch. No lamps or light sources.
- Floor-mates didn't recall any other outages in the apartment over the past year. Unfortunately, they weren't home at the time and couldn't give firsthand accounts.
	- You might not usually notice small outages like this (at least enough to recall the memory months later).
- I was pretty bothered by the whole experience, mulling it over for the rest of the evening.
- I don't remember anything this weird having happened to me before, and I have no history of hallucinations. I'm a happy and healthy 20 year old.

For a moment, my heart started beating and I felt a bit [freaked out](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mja6jZ6k9gAwki9Nu/the-mystery-of-the-haunted-rationalist). This was quickly replaced with "wait, why am I even considering ghost stories before I imagine worlds where someone, like, installed cameras and is toying with me (not a great explanation, but much better than the former).

This reminded me a lot of [The Pyramid And The Garden](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9HSwh2mE3tX6xvZ2W/the-pyramid-and-the-garden), and I've now come to a similar conclusion. 
The best fitting story seems to be that this was just a really weirdly timed blackout.

Some things that could happen immediately before an outage that would elicit a similar reaction:
- "Hey could you turn off the light?"
- * Someone yells * "God, if you're real give me a sign!"
- Watching a horror movie during a scary part / saying "Bloody Mary" / playing with a Ouija board / mentioning you're scared of the dark / seeing something scary
- Reading / seeing something about power outages
- Your cat knocks a vase off of a shelf?
Most of these are way less likely than the relatively common phrase "could you turn off the light?" 
I'd like to think of more examples that match it's specific weirdness level.

I've had the ability to notice when I observe a really unlikely event for around 10 years. This is the first time I've noticed something this weird. The thing about really unlikely events is that they're still expected to occur at some interval, so if you're considering the number of times I've witnessed *any* extremely unlikely event, regardless of what it is, I think this rate might make some sense.

If, on average, you'd observe an event this weird once every 30 years, an exponential distribution ($P[T\le t]=1-e^{-\lambda t}$) puts my odds at 28% in 10 years and 86% in 60 years, which doesn't seem that crazy.

Maybe I should be quicker to question my mental coherence. I don't have a good sense for base rates of seeing weird things like this. I'm curious to hear your experiences!
